            //In this example,  
            //1 - We start by defining the IAuthenticationService interface with two methods: 
            //AuthenticateUser and AuthorizeUser.The BasicAuthenticationService class
            //implements this interface and provides the specific implementation for these
            //methods.
            //2-In the BasicAuthenticationService class, the AuthenticateUser method
            //compares the provided username and password with the stored credentials.It
            //returns true if the user is authenticated and false otherwise.The AuthorizeUser
            //method checks if the user with the given username has the specified role.It
            //returns true if the user is authorized and false otherwise.
            //3-In the Main method, we create an instance of the BasicAuthenticationService
            //class and assign it to the authService variable of type IAuthenticationService.
            //We then call the AuthenticateUser and AuthorizeUser methods using this
            //interface reference.. 


            //IAuthenticationService authenticationService = new BasicAuthenticationService();

                //2-We then create three classes: EmailNotificationService, 
                //SmsNotificationService, and PushNotificationService, which implement the

                //3-In each implementation, we provide the logic to send notifications through
                //the respective communication channel: 
                //4-The EmailNotificationService class simulates sending an email by outputting
                //a message to the console.
                //5-The SmsNotificationService class simulates sending an SMS by outputting a
                //message to the console.

                //outputting a message to the console.
